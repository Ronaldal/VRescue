## Virtual Reality Medical Simulator
### Members: Ronald Alhazov and Ohad Goldberg

### Introduction
This project aims to develop a virtual reality medical simulator designed to simulate a variety of basic medical scenarios and their treatments. The central concept involves mapping a physical mannequin into a virtual environment to create realistic medical scenarios.

### Problem Statement and Significance
In recent months, both team members participated in conflicts in Israel and experienced firsthand the critical importance of medical operations on the battlefield. Timely medical interventions were observed to have a significant impact on outcomes and the ability to save lives. This project aims to underscore the importance of medical operations and enhance success rates for those performing medical procedures in real-life situations. Individuals often find themselves in situations where they need to perform medical actions, and utilizing simulations can potentially increase success rates.

### Objectives
1. Develop a realistic virtual environment for simulating medical scenarios.
2. Integrate a physical mannequin into the virtual environment to provide a hands-on experience.  
3. Create a range of medical scenarios with varying levels of complexity.
4. Implement a scoring and feedback system to evaluate user performance.
5. Provide an accessible platform for non-professionals to practice medical procedures.


### Game interface
Game users:
One user that gives the medical treatment. The main player is part of a situation in which he functions as a one of others and not necessarily the one who leads the situation (for example : the one who seats next to driver) and he actually performs the medical treatment on the person he is called upon to treat.

### Screens Structure
1.Main menu
1.1. Check the mannequin and equipment is connected.
1.2. Select medical scenario
 1.2.1. Driving accident
 1.2.2. Battle field
1.3. Check my treatment history and medical information
1.4. Exit

### Screen overview
#### Main menu 
The game main menu will display the home screen of the simulator where the player can choose the option he wants. check the mannequin and VR equipment, select medical scenario, treatment history or exit.
