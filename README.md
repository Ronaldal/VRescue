## Virtual Reality Medical Simulator
### Members: Ronald Alhazov and Ohad Goldberg

### Introduction
This project aims to develop a virtual reality medical simulator designed to simulate a variety of basic medical scenarios and their treatments. The central concept involves mapping a physical mannequin into a virtual environment to create realistic medical scenarios.

### Problem Statement and Significance
In recent months, both team members participated in conflicts in Israel and experienced firsthand the critical importance of medical operations on the battlefield. Timely medical interventions were observed to have a significant impact on outcomes and the ability to save lives. This project aims to underscore the importance of medical operations and enhance success rates for those performing medical procedures in real-life situations. Individuals often find themselves in situations where they need to perform medical actions, and utilizing simulations can potentially increase success rates.
